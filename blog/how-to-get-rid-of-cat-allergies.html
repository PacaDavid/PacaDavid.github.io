                <p>Cats can make amazing pets, but being allergic to them can be incredibly challenging.

Maybe you have a cat, and you've just developed allergies. Whatever the case, there are certain steps that you can take to reduce the impact of cat allergies on your daily life.</p>

                    'It\'s a common misconception that cat allergies are caused by cat fur, which leads people to believe that hairless cats are the solution to cat allergies, but the true cause of cat allergies is a protein called Fel D1, which is found in cat saliva. After cats clean themselves, the saliva dries, and Fel D1 becomes airborne, causing allergic reactions in some people.',
                    'At the most basic level, allergies occur when the body\'s immune system believes that something is harmful (e.g., cats, peanuts, etc.) when it isn\'t. When the body senses something dangerous, the immune system begins a full scale attack to neutralize the perceived threat, which is what creates the allergy symptoms.',
                    'Certain cats are also better for allergies. Male cats, especially intact males, tend to produce more allergens. Additionally, <a href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/cat-allergies/what-are-the-best-cat-breeds-for-allergies" title="What Are the Best Cat Breeds for Allergies" target="_blank">some breeds</a> are known for being more hypoallergenic such as Devon Rex and Sphynx, although it\'s important to note that no cat is completely hypoallergenic.'

When your body has an allergic reaction, your immune system will generate histamines to fight the allergens. Histamines generate many of the symptoms of cat allergies and can be tempered with antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin) or cetirizine (Zyrtec).</p><p>Antihistamines can be useful in certain situations. For example, if you\'re going to be around cats for a temporary period of time, antihistamines are likely the most appropriate solution. Antihistamines are less suitable for longer periods of time since you will likely build a <a title="Building Tolerance Towards Antihistamines" href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/0021-8707%2851%2990033-0/fulltext#:~:text=The%20evidence%20presented%20does%20suggest,14%20days)%20before%20resuming%20therapy." target="_blank">tolerance</a>. Additionally, most drugs in the antihistamine class create significant drowsiness.</p><p>Make sure you discuss options with your doctor because there can also be negative drug interactions with antihistamines, and your doctor can also help you find the best option.</p><h3>Cat Allergy Wipes</h3><p>One relatively inexpensive solution is allergy wipes. Going along with the grooming solutions, cat allergy wipes are specially designed to reduce the dander on your cat while cleaning their fur.</p><h3>Cat Allergy Sprays</h3><p>Cat allergy sprays claim to neutralize allergens when sprayed on any kind of surface, so they can be a helpful addition to your cleaning routine. It\'s also important to make sure that all ingredients in the spray are safe for cats. Generally, however, most brands make sprays that the cats themselves don\'t like or are dangerous to both the cats and owners.
