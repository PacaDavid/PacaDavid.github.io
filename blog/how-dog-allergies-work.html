                <p>For many of us, the wag of a tail or a slobbery kiss is the highlight of our day. But for millions, these loving gestures can come with an unwanted side of sneezing, itching, or even asthma-like symptoms. Dog allergies are surprisingly common — and just as misunderstood.</p>
                <p>Let's break down what's really happening when your body reacts to dogs and which myths you can finally stop believing.</p>

Hence, <a title="Hypoallergenic dogs" href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/dog-allergies/best-hypoallergenic-dogs" target="_blank">even a hairless dog can cause allergies</a>.</p><p><strong>Myth 2:</strong> "There are hypoallergenic breeds"<br><strong>Truth:</strong> There\'s no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog. Some breeds may shed less or produce fewer allergens, but all dogs produce Can f 1 and Can f 2 to some extent. When selecting your next furry friend, do your research about <a href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/dog-allergies/what-dogs-are-hypoallergenic" title="What dogs are hypoallergenic" target="_blank">the breeds</a> that are less likely to cause allergies.</p><p><strong>Myth 3:</strong> "Getting rid of your dog will fix everything"<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Sorry, not instantly. These allergens <a href="https://acaai.org/resource/pet-allergies/" title="Pet allergies" target="_blank">stick around</a>.

As mentioned by Dr. Andrew Findlaytor, "having a safe spot to rest is extremely important for your immune system to recharge, especially if you are having a bad allergy day."</li><li><strong>Groom your dog regularly:</strong> Grooming and bathing regularly reduces shedding and dander. It is ideal if this is done outdoors and by someone who is not allergic to dogs. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind not to overbathe them as this can cause irritation in the pet\'s skin and consequently increase their amount of allergens released.</li><li><strong>HEPA filters:</strong> Use <a rel="noopener" title="Best HEPA filters for home" href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/general-allergies/best-allergy-air-purifiers" target="_blank">HEPA filters</a> in areas where your pet tends to hang out the most. These filters are designed to capture a high percentage of airborne particles, including pet dander, which is a common trigger.</li><li><strong>Have an easy washable cat/dog bed:</strong> Make sure to wash this at least once per week in hot water that is at least 130°F.</li><li><strong>Choose the right breed of dogs:</strong> Even though there is no 100% hypoallergenic breed, there are some dog <a rel="noopener" title="Hypoallergenic dogs" href="https://pacagen.com/blogs/dog-allergies/what-dogs-are-hypoallergenic" target="_blank">breeds</a> that produce less dander and may be a better fit.</li><li><strong>Expose kids to pets early on:</strong> Numerous <a rel="noopener" title="Early exposure to pets" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1999.00534.x" target="_blank">scientific studies</a> suggest pet exposure during the first year of life is associated with lower chances of developing allergic rhinitis and asthma.</li><li><strong>Use allergen-neutralizing sprays:</strong> Traditional allergy meds like antihistamines and nasal sprays help, but a new wave of biotech is changing the game. <a rel="noopener" title="Dog Allergen Neutralizing Spray" href="https://pacagen.com/products/dog-allergen-neutralizing-spray" target="_blank">Pacagen\'s Dog Allergen Neutralizing Spray</a> uses a protein-based technology called <a rel="noopener" title="Pacagen\'s technology" href="https://pacagen.com/pages/our-science" target="_blank">WhiskerBlock Beta</a>.
