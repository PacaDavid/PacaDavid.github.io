                <p>If cuddling your cat leaves you sneezing, congested, or with itchy eyes, you're not alone. Cat allergies are incredibly common, affecting millions of people in the U.S. alone. But what actually triggers these reactions, and what can you realistically do about it? Let's break it down.</p>
