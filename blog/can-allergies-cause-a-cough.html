                <p dir="ltr">Coughing is a natural reflex that clears the airways and protects the respiratory system. However, when coughing becomes chronic or occurs without an obvious cause, many people begin to wonder: "Can allergies cause a cough?" The answer is yes. Both humans and animals can experience coughing as a symptom of allergies. This blog explores the link between allergies and coughing, with a particular focus on pet allergies and coughing in dogs and cats.</p>

When allergens irritate the nasal passages, excess mucus is produced and can drip down the back of the throat causing a reflexive cough.
